1. Urban has lower average fare and higher rides amount in general,
   Suburban average fare and rides amount in the middle in general,
   Rural has higher average fare and lower rides amount in general,
   and the more rides, the lower average fare in general

2. Urban cities have most drivers in general,
   Suburban cities have middle amount of drivers in general,
   Rural cities have least drivers in general,
   So the more drivers, the more rides, the lower fare in general.

3. However, average fare is not only decided by driver amount and ride amount in a city.

4. Fares and Rides are correlated well for three type of cities: Urban, Suburban and Rural, drivers amounts seem not correlated so well with the other two.
